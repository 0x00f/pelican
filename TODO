* Add a way to support pictures (see how sphinx makes that)
* Create templates for tags/categories: they're not implemented !
* Add a way to categorize by paths, and to add dates by filenames. This will
  allow users to avoid the need of metadatas. I'm thinking about a repository
  like that:
      .
      ├── category1
      │   ├── 2010-12-15-hello-world.rst
      │   └── 2010-12-20-my-super-article.rst

  I dont consider the tags as something mandatory, so they will be provided by
  metadatas whithin the files themselves. That's also important to note that
  there will be a need to actually change *something* in the files. A better way
  to work would be to avoid any change if possible (I'm wondering if removing
  the date is a good option…)
* Add a way to have multiple feeds (one by category), plus one global, and to
  send this to the templates.
